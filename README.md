</p>

![extension-preview-large-image-demo](./demo.gif)

## 🧐 motivation

When I browse some websites, there the interaction with the picture is not very consistent, some have the function of providing a quick view of the big picture, some are fixed size picture layout, can not directly view the actual size of picture. It's annoyed to me.

## 🔧 Install

- go [release](https://github.com/liuxingyu521/extension-preview-large-image/releases) page, and download the `zip` file in Assets area, then decompress the file.

- Open the Chrome browser and go to `chrome://extensions/`, and enable Developer Mode.

- Click the `Load unzipped extensions` button and select the folder you just extracted

## 🎈 Usage

just right click the image element,then select the `preview the large image`


## 🖼️ Image / Video Takeover

When you visit an image or video URL directly and the server responds with `Content-Disposition: attachment`, the extension redirects you to a built-in viewer page where you can preview and download the file.

- Normal, directly-previewable images and videos keep the browser's native preview.
- The takeover can be enabled/disabled separately for images and videos in the extension popup.
- Works in both Chrome and Firefox.

## ⛏️ Built Using

- [Wxt](https://wxt.dev/) - the extension framework
- [viewerjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewerjs) - preview image tool
